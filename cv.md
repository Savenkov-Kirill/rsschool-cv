### About me:
I started my career path with a company that deals with plant seedlings. There I became an email marketer and created a channel from 0. I reached the ceiling and realized it was time to move on. The next company turned out to be an email marketing agency. There I became a technical specialist and dealt with the technical part. At the moment I work with large companies and lead 5 projects. My main tasks are related to the technical part:
- layout of email newsletters
- design
- service integration
- working with Mindbox, unisender, DashaMail, SendPulse, MailChimp, customer.io.
- customization of promotions, complex mechanics.
- script customization
- interaction with the development team

I decided to learn frontend since everything is going towards it. I learned HTML and CSS basics while designing mailing lists (table layout is still...). I like the technical part, I like to understand the code and functionality. And probably the main reason why I decided to go into frontend is the visual result. I write code - I see the result, fix a bug - I see the result, roll up a web site - I see the result.
